# Code for "What time is it? Interactions between trees and fossils"
1) [character_evolution_effect.R](https://github.com/TomCarr/clade_fossil_delay/blob/main/character_evolution_effect.R) does the simulation for the character evolution effect. Parameters to be adjusted as desired

2) [constant_rates_extinct_lineage_effect.R](https://github.com/TomCarr/clade_fossil_delay/blob/main/constant_rates_extinct_lineage_effect.R) does the extinct lineage effect with constant rates

3) [mass_extinction_extinct_lineage_effect](https://github.com/TomCarr/clade_fossil_delay/blob/main/mass_extinction_extinct_lineage_effect.R) does the mass extinct lineage effect with mass extinction

4) [mass_ext_fbd_simulater.R](https://github.com/TomCarr/clade_fossil_delay/blob/main/mass_ext_fbd_simulater.R) does the simulation with a mass extinction for subsequent fossilised birth death analysis

5) [constant_ext_fbd_simulater.R](https://github.com/TomCarr/clade_fossil_delay/blob/main/constant_ext_fbd_simulater.R) does the simulation with a constant extinction for subsequent fossilised birth death analysis

6) [fossilised_birth_death_dating.Rev](https://github.com/TomCarr/clade_fossil_delay/blob/main/fossilised_birth_death_dating.Rev) divergence time estimation with fossilised birth death
